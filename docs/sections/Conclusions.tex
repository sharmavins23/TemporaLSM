\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:Conclusions}

Our project presents a framework for generating and analyzing self-organizing
neural networks in order to derive insight into the neural basis for cognition
through the orientation of the problem. Through analyzing the networks, we hope
to uncover similarities and understand how these structures may organize and
train to particular problems.

\subsection{Plans for Next Milestone}

By the end of November, we plan to complete our network generation framework,
alongside a number of other seed networks and neuron types. We also plan to
generate and analyze the generated MNIST network \cite{MNIST Dataset} as well
as the NFL big data bowl network \cite{NFL Dataset}.

\subsection{Contribution}

For this milestone, Vins focused on the input vector and SNL neuron
implementation. In contrast, Anand focused on the initial graph organization and
seed matrix generation. Both teammates contributed to the overall design of the
TLSM generator framework, and both teammates will contribute to design and
analysis of the MNIST network \cite{MNIST Dataset}.

In the future, Anand will be responsible for the design and analysis of an NFL
data network \cite{NFL Dataset}, and Vins will be responsible for the NAB
network \cite{NAB Dataset}.
