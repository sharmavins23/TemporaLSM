\section{Experimental Setup and Results} \label{sec:ExperimentalSetup}

Our first benchmark and first goal is the MNIST dataset \cite{MNIST Dataset} and
the creation of a framework that can automate this procedure. In this milestone
we have completed the design for the Step No-Leak (SNL) neuron, as well as the
input vector and liquid reservoir. Other neuron types are in progress, and the
temporal mini-column enabling supervised training has yet to be implemented.

We also have a number of seed networks implemented and ready for initializing
and training weights - These include Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barabasi-
Albert random graphs. We also have a fully-connected structure for comparison.
