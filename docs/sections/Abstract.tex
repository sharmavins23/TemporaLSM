    Liquid state machines (LSMs) are machine learning models that create more
    biologically plausible neural networks by self-organizing neurons into a
    'liquid'. As such, we aim to analyze a variety of 'liquids' generated off
    unique problems and datasets in order to determine correlations and patterns
    that exist in these graphs. We accomplish this by: (1) Implementing a
    framework to generate LSMs on many problems, and (2) Analyzing generated
    LSMs for overlapping patterns and similarities.
