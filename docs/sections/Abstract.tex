    Liquid state machines (LSMs) are machine learning models that create more
    biologically plausible neural networks by self-organizing neurons into a
    'liquid'. In this project we aim to analyze a variety of 'liquids' created
    through the MNIST dataset in order to determine correlations and patterns
    that exist in these graphs. We intend to utilize this information to draw
    conclusions about the liquid's training model of Spike-Timing-Dependent
    Plasticity (STDP), as well as understand more about liquid state machines
    themselves. We accomplish this by: (1) Implementing a framework to generate
    LSMs on particular datasets and configurations, and (2) Analyzing generated
    LSMs for overlapping patterns and similarities.
