# TemporaLSM

This repository contains an implementation framework for Liquid State Machines
(LSMs) implemented with temporal neurons, or Temporal Liquid State Machines
(TLSMs).

# To-Do

The following are nice-to-have features or potential things that this project
enables us to explore, that we'd like to explore:

-   Ramp No-Leak (RNL) neurons
-   Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons
-   Inhibitory neurons (neurons with negative action potentials; How should STDP
    rules change for them?)
