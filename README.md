# TemporaLSM

This repository contains an implementation framework for Liquid State Machines
(LSMs) implemented with temporal neurons, or Temporal Liquid State Machines
(TLSMs).

## How to run?

The project is designed with Python 3.11.3 and primarily runs via PyTorch. To
run, simply change the parameters in the `main.py` file and run it via
`python3 main.py` or `python main.py`. It will automatically output results to
the `results` folder for training with `n=10`, `n=100`, and `n=1000` training
samples.
